    "intro": "<p>We know. It’s been a long minute since you’ve had places to go and people to see.</p>\n\n<p>But now, more people are getting vaccinated and more places are opening up under Phase 3 of the state’s reopening plan, which allows indoor entertainment venues to operate at 50% capacity, or 400 people, whichever is less. Even so, many arts and culture organizations are taking it slowly.</p>\n\n<p>Among the venues that have reopened or soon will are museums and galleries. Here are some exhibits and venues that caught our features staffers’ eyes. The list is not comprehensive; rather, it’s meant as a place to start your explorations when you feel comfortable doing so. (Be mindful that COVID-19 cases are on the rise again.)</p>\n\n<p>Because COVID-19 safety requirements — many venues have mask, social distancing and timed entry requirements, for instance — as well as things like hours and dates of operation, can change, it’s always a good idea to call or check each venue’s website before you go.</p>"
